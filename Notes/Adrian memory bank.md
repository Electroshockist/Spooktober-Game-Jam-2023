got navigation sort of working

enemy walks down slopes despite not being able to control its y velocity?
enemy sometimes instantly rotates to face player despite not having that player as a target?
enemy will sometimes follow player forever instead of going to their last known position?
enemy sometimes takes illogical paths?

enemy should instantly alert if they're searching for your last known position and see you. they should only forget you one they go to your last known pos and don't find you
